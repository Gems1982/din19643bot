# MDB Technik — Methods and Expertise

MDB Technik Germany specializes in:
- Repair of leaking pools
- Rehabilitation of concrete substrates
- Application of expandable polyurea coatings
- Refurbishment of public and private pool structures
- Technical system replacement

## Expandable Polyurea Protection
Expandable polyurea provides:
- High crack-bridging capability
- Excellent chemical resistance to chlorinated water
- Fast curing times enabling minimal downtime
- Seamless membrane formation
- Waterproofing for concrete basins, balance tanks, technical rooms, gutters

## Application Workflow
1. Substrate diagnosis (moisture, cohesion, carbonation)
2. Mechanical prep (shot-blasting, grinding)
3. Priming adapted to substrate condition
4. Polyurea spray application in defined thickness
5. Sealing of penetrations, drains, flanges
6. Optional wear layer or UV topcoat

## Typical Use Cases
- Deteriorated concrete basins in public pools
- Osmosis and moisture infiltration damage
- Cracked balance tanks
- Flange and pipe penetration failures
- Technical rooms with chemical exposure

## Strengths in Public Pool Environments
- Resistant to chlorides, oxidizers, and cleaning chemicals
- Fast commissioning → less downtime for operators
- Ideal for retrofit situations
