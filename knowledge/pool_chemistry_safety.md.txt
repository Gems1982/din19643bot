# Safety Principles in Pool Water Chemistry

## General Safety
- Never mix chemicals directly.
- Always add chemicals using dosing pumps.
- Follow German TRGS and operator safety rules.
- Use PPE for all handling.

## Chlorine Safety
- Gas chlorine requires certified handling procedures.
- Liquid chlorine (hypochlorite) degrades with temperature and UV.
- Store separately from acids.

## Acid Safety
- Used for pH control.
- Must not contact chlorine products.
- Dosing lines must be entirely separate.

## Flocculant Safety
- Typically PAC-based.
- Avoid overdosing → can clog filters.

## Backwash Safety
- Ensure no backflow into clean water system.
- Observe temperature limits in wastewater.
