# DIN 19643 — Summary (Legally Safe Reformulation)

DIN 19643 governs the treatment of swimming pool and bathing water in public facilities in Germany. Its purpose is to ensure hygienic, chemical, and physical water safety for bathers.

## Core Principles
- Continuous recirculation and treatment of pool water.
- Defined turnover rates depending on pool type and load.
- Multi-stage treatment train required:
  1. Mechanical separation (filtration)
  2. Adsorptive removal (activated carbon depending on subtype)
  3. Oxidation/disinfection (chlorine-based)
  4. pH control
  5. Optional flocculation/precipitation

## DIN 19643 Process Types
The standard defines multiple permissible “process chains”. Samples:

- Type 1: Flocculation + Filtration + Chlorination
- Type 2: Flocculation + Granular Activated Carbon + Filtration + Chlorination
- Type 3: Powder activated carbon + Filtration + Chlorination
- Type 4: Membrane filtration (UF) + Chlorination (used in modern pools)

## Key Performance Requirements
- Defined filter velocity limits (typically ~30 m/h for public pools; exact values depend on design).
- Minimum free chlorine residual.
- pH control in a narrow operating range.
- Turbidity thresholds for treated water.
- Redox levels within operational range.
- TOC removal dependent on selected process type.

## Hydraulic Requirements
- Even distribution of inlet and outlet flows.
- Defined surface extraction rates (skimmers or overflow gutters).
- Sufficient bottom extraction for hydraulically quiet zones.
- Avoidance of untreated pockets.
- Guaranteed turnover per basin type (e.g., toddler pools faster than sports pools).

## Monitoring Requirements
DIN 19643 requires continuous monitoring of:
- Free chlorine
- Combined chlorine / chloramines
- pH value
- Redox potential
- Temperature
- Turbidity (NTU/TE/FNU depending on device)

Daily manual checks are required to supplement sensors.

## Safety Notes
- Dosing installations must follow German TRGS regulations.
- Backwash water must achieve defined rinse quality.
- Chemicals must be stored and prepared according to safety law.
