# Water Treatment Basics for Public Pools

## Treatment Train Overview
Public pool water must pass through a continuous cycle:
1. Pool → 2. Balance tank → 3. Pump → 4. Flocculant → 5. Filter → 6. Adsorption stage (if used) → 7. Heating → 8. Chemical dosing → 9. Return to pool

## Filtration
Goals:
- Remove suspended solids
- Reduce turbidity
- Create stable disinfection conditions

Typical sand/AFM filter specs:
- Bed depth: 1.0–1.2 m
- Multi-layer mix possible (coarse → fine)
- Filtration velocity: 20–30 m/h for public pools

## Backwash
Performed daily or based on pressure differential.
Critical elements:
- Sufficient flow (~55–60 m/h bed expansion)
- Separate rinse stage until water is clear
- Air scour (optional) to break compaction

## Disinfection
Chlorine remains mandatory for DIN-compliant public pools.
Important parameters:
- Free chlorine residual (min/max defined by regulation)
- Combined chlorine (indicator for chloramines)
- CT value logic is used for hygiene safety

## pH Control
Ideal operational window: typically 6.8–7.4  
pH directly influences:
- Chlorine disinfection power
- Comfort for swimmers
- Scale/corrosion behavior

## Flocculation
Essential for removing:
- Micro-particles <10 microns
- Dissolved organic substances
- Colloids

Continuous dosing via PAC (poly-aluminum compounds).

## Heating & Energy
- Plate heat exchangers common
- Heat pumps increasingly used
- Recovery from backwash and wastewater possible

## Goals of Treatment Design
- Stable chemistry
- Minimal chloramine generation
- High clarity (<0.3 NTU)
- Safe microbiological performance
